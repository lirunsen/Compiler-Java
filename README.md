# Compiler-Java
This is a simple compiler written in Java, designed for learning compiler theory. It can compile arithmetic expressions into pseudo-assembly language.  
Run `Compiler.main()`, and Input arithmetic expressions in the console

## Lexical Analysis
The process of converting a character sequence into a sequence of tokens.  
Example:

## Parsing
A process that involves analyzing an input text consisting of a sequence of tokens based on a given formal grammar, and determining its syntactic structure.  
Example:

## Create Pseudo-assembly Language
Generate assembly language suitable for execution by programmable devices such as CPU. The compiler in this project produces pseudo-assembly language.
